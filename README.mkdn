About 3D
========
This is a experimental fork targeted at adding 3d support to until-it-dies
There is not much to see yet, and chances are what can be seen is pretty slow.
If you want to see something, load test.lisp in the 3d directory and run the sample engine there


About
=====

Until It Dies is a simple game and application engine designed to make it damn easy to get a window
up to display all the shiny things you might want to do. It has support for image loading, sound,
and fonts.

UID uses OpenGL to draw graphics, and a prototype-based object system, Sheeple, for its API.

UID itself is MIT licensed, and all its dependencies use permissive licenses. See below for specifics.

Getting it to run
=================

UID is split into several modules. The base system, `until-it-dies.base`, includes the basics for
the engine, such as windowing, the resource manager, the event queue, primitive drawing, and
colors. If this is all you need, you can simply asdf-load until-it-dies.base. The only dependencies
for this base system are Sheeple and CL-OpenGL. You must also have glfw installed in your system.

Besides the base system, UID currently includes systems that provide fancier features, which can
optionally be loaded:

* `until-it-dies.graphics` provides image loading, textures, animations, text rendering, and
  sprites. It requires that ftgl and devil be installed.

* `until-it-dies.sound` provides positional audio. You must have openal and freealut installed in
  order to use this module. This module also depends on cl-openal for bindings.

If you want the whole thing, the `until-it-dies.asd` system will load everything.

As of right now, all of the modules dump their symbols into the base until-it-dies package.

How the hell do I use it?
=========================

You're on your own there for now. UID is still pretty new, so I haven't written up a manual. If you
want to use it, I recommend checking out demo/testgame.lisp for a nice example of a simple
application written with UID's API. You may also want to look at Sheeple and its API.

If you're working on something and want help, feel free to e-mail me (sykopomp@sykosomatic.org), or
show up it #sykosomatic@freenode on IRC, and I'll do my best to help you get going.
